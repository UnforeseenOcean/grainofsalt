--------
Under 64-bit Linux
--------
You do not need to compile the program. It is already statically
compiled, you only need to execute it in a 64-bit Linux environment.

--------
Compile with cmake
--------
You need cmake. Install cmake, and then go into the 
"build/" directory, and issue:

cmake ../
make

You will then have the "grainofsalt" tool in the "build" directory.

---------
Compile with autotools
---------
Go to the 'build' directory. Issue

../configure
make
